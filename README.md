# kotlin-card-war
This is a simple simulation of the card game called War. It was a project built in order to learn how Kotlin code works.

The rules for how to play the real game with actual cards can be found on [BicycleCards.com](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/)

If you look over the code and notice something is incorrect, feel free to submit a change and PR, I'd love the feedback.

## Enjoy
